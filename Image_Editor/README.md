## Image Editor


This is a simple image editor that can be used to apply filters to any image that you want, reset the photo, and then download it after the editing.
This works on the simple idea of changing the CSS property using JavaScript. HTML canvas is used to add photos. The user can upload any type of photo. and then with three buttons, namely grey scale, Blue Monoton and orange blue filters, a filter is applied.


We have to upload the image first, which we need to work on.
Then there are three filters:
1. Grey Scale
2. Blue Monoton
3. Orange blue (Duotone)


You can also reset the image, and after you have done with editing the image, you can download it by clicking the download button.
